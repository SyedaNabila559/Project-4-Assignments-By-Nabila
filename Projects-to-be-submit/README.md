# 🚀 Project-4-Assignments: Python Mini-Projects Collection 🐍
Welcome to the Python Mini-Projects Collection! This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly Python assignments 🎓 and exciting Python projects 🔥 that help you learn the fundamentals of programming through interactive coding challenges.

# 📌 Assignments 1 to 6
These assignments help you grasp basic Python programming concepts by completing fun and interactive challenges:

# 1️⃣ Assignment 1: Mad Libs Python Project 🤪
# Objective:
Create funny stories using user input.
In this project, the user will input words (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives), and the program will fill those into a template, generating a funny story.

# Features:
User-friendly prompts for input.

Generates creative stories using basic Python string formatting.

# 2️⃣ Assignment 2: Guess the Number Game (Computer) 🎮
# Objective:
The computer picks a number, and the user tries to guess it.
In this game, the user will guess numbers, and the computer will give hints on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

# Features:
Random number generation.

Feedback provided for high/low guesses.

# 3️⃣ Assignment 3: Guess the Number Game (User) 🧠
# Objective:
The user picks a number, and the computer guesses it.
In this version of the game, the user thinks of a number, and the computer attempts to guess it using a binary search strategy.

# Features:
Computer uses a guessing algorithm.

User gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

# 4️⃣ Assignment 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊✋✌️
# Objective:
Classic game using Python logic.
The user plays against the computer, choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The program determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game.

# Features:
User input for guessing letters.

A word is displayed with blank spaces, showing correctly guessed letters.

Limitation on wrong guesses.

# 6️⃣ Assignment 6: Countdown Timer ⏰
# Objective:
A simple timer using Python’s time module.
The program asks the user for a time in seconds and counts down from that number, alerting when time is up.

# Features:
User can input a time in seconds.

The program counts down and prints the time remaining.

Timer completion alert.
