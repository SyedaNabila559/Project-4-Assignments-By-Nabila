# Python Madlib Script 🤖✍️
# Overview 🌟
This is a fun Python program that generates a "madlib" story based on user input. The script prompts the user for specific words (such as adjectives, verbs, nouns, and numbers) and then creates a story using those inputs. 🎉

# Features 🎮
Takes input for various parts of speech (e.g., adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.). 🗣️

Generates a humorous story based on user-provided words. 😂

Provides a unique output each time depending on the user's input. 🔄

# Installation 📥
To run this program, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. 🐍

# Example:
When you run the program, it will ask for inputs like this:

Adjective: funny 😂
Person name: John 👨
Noun: computer 💻
Verb: fix 🔧
Another verb: run 🏃‍♂️
Number: 3️⃣
Symbol: $ 💵

The output will look something like this:

I was writing a funny Python script when suddenly, John yelled 😱,
"Why is this computer not working?! 😩"

Turns out, they forgot to fix the computer before running it. 🤦‍♂️
After 3️⃣ hours of debugging ⏰, the solution was just adding a $ 💵⚡️.

Moral of the story: Always fix before you run! 😅💡
