Welcome to the Agreement Bot! This fun Python program asks the user for their favorite animal and responds with a friendly message agreeing with their choice. It’s a simple and interactive way to practice working with user inputs in Python.

# 📝 Features
User Interaction: The bot asks the user to input their favorite animal.

Friendly Response: The bot agrees with the user by stating that it also loves the same animal.

Case-Insensitive: The bot responds to the input in a case-insensitive manner, converting the user input to lowercase for a consistent response.

# 🧑‍💻 How It Works
Step 1: The program welcomes the user with a message ("Welcome to the Agreement Bot!").

Step 2: It asks the user, "What's your favorite animal?" and stores their response.

Step 3: The bot then agrees with the user by printing a message like, "My favorite animal is also [user's favorite animal]!"

Step 4: The animal name is converted to lowercase to ensure the response is case-insensitive.

My favorite animal is also tiger!
# Explanation:
