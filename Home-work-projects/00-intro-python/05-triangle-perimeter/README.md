# 5. ⛺️ Triangle Perimeter Calculator 📐
Welcome to the Triangle Perimeter Calculator! This Python program calculates the perimeter of a triangle based on user input. It prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, calculates the perimeter by summing these lengths, and then prints the result.

# 📝 Features
User Input: The program asks the user for the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.

Perimeter Calculation: It calculates the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of the three sides.

Result Display: The program prints the calculated perimeter.

# 🧑‍💻 How It Works
Step 1: The program welcomes the user and explains its purpose.

Step 2: It prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle (side1, side2, side3).

Step 3: The program calculates the perimeter by summing the three sides:

Perimeter
=
side1
+
side2
+
side3
Perimeter=side1+side2+side3
Step 4: The program prints the calculated perimeter.

# 📌 Example Output
Here’s an example of how the program works:


Welcome to the Triangle Perimeter Calculator!
What is the length of side 1? 5
What is the length of side 2? 7
What is the length of side 3? 10
The perimeter of the triangle is 22.0
# Explanation:

User Input: The user enters side1 = 5, side2 = 7, side3 = 10.

Calculation: The program calculates the perimeter as 
5
+
7
+
10
=
22
5+7+10=22.

Output: The result is displayed as:
"The perimeter of the triangle is 22.0"
