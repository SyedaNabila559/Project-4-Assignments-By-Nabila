# 4.👥Age Calculation Program 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Welcome to the Age Calculation Program! This Python script calculates the ages of five friends based on their relationships to each other. It uses simple arithmetic operations and stores the results in variables. The program then prints each friend’s name and age.

# 📝 Features
Age Relationships: The program uses known relationships between the ages of the friends:

Anton is 21 years old.

Beth is 6 years older than Anton.

Chen is 20 years older than Beth.

Drew is as old as the combined ages of Chen and Anton.

Ethan is the same age as Chen.

Prints Results: The program prints the name and age of each friend.

# 🧑‍💻 How It Works
Step 1: The program assigns the age of Anton to 21.

Step 2: It calculates the ages of Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan based on the given relationships.

Step 3: It prints the names and ages of all five friends.

# 📌 Example Output
Here’s how the program displays the ages of the friends:

Anton is 21
Beth is 27
Chen is 47
Drew is 68
Ethan is 47
# Explanation:

Anton: Fixed at 21 years old.

Beth: 6 years older than Anton, so 27 years old.

Chen: 20 years older than Beth, so 47 years old.

Drew: Sum of Anton’s age (21) and Chen’s age (47), so 68 years old.

Ethan: Same age as Chen, so 47 years old.
