# Python Programmer Madlib Story 🐍💻

This Python program generates a fun and interactive Madlib story with a Python programmer theme. 🎉  
It prompts the user to input various words and phrases, which are then used to fill in the blanks of a pre-defined story template. The completed story is printed out for the user to enjoy! 🤩

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program asks the user to input different types of words (name, adjective, noun, verb, funny phrase, etc.). 📝
2. It uses the user’s inputs to fill in a fun and quirky Madlib story that features a Python programmer debugging code. 💻
3. The program prints the hilarious story with the user’s inputs! 🎉

## Example 📍

Enter your name: Alice Enter an adjective: crazy Enter a noun: laptop Enter a verb ending in -ing: crashing Enter a funny phrase: "Have you tried turning it off and on?" Enter a random object: rubber duck Enter a random action: flying Enter a silly method to fix bugs: yelling "magic words" Enter a random word: unicorn
