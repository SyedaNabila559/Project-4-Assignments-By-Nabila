# Pythagorean Theorem Calculator 📐

This Python program calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It prompts the user to enter the lengths of the two legs of the triangle and calculates the hypotenuse. 🌟

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program prompts the user to input the lengths of the two legs (AB and AC) of a right triangle. 🦵
2. It then calculates the length of the hypotenuse (BC) using the formula:  
   \[
   BC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2}
   \]
3. The result is printed, showing the length of the hypotenuse. 📏
