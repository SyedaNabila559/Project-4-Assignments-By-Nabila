# Mass-Energy Calculator 💥

This Python program calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's famous equation \(E = mc^2\). 🌟  
It demonstrates how much energy is stored in mass, using the speed of light constant. 🌌

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program prompts the user to input a mass in kilograms. ⚖️
2. It uses the formula \( E = mc^2 \), where:
   - \( E \) is the energy in joules ⚡
   - \( m \) is the mass in kilograms 🏋️‍♂️
   - \( c \) is the speed of light (299,792,458 meters per second) 🌠
3. The program then calculates and prints the energy in joules. 💡
