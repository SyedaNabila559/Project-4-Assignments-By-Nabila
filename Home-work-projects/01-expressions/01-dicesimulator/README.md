# Dice Rolling Simulator 🎲

This Python program simulates rolling two 6-sided dice and prints their total. The program also demonstrates how to use functions to simulate rolling dice multiple times. 🎉

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program defines two dice with 6 sides. 🎰
2. It simulates rolling two dice using the `roll_dice()` function, which generates random numbers for each die. 🎲
3. The program prints the total sum of both dice for each roll. 🧮
4. The value of `dice1` is printed before and after calling the `roll_dice()` function to show that the dice rolls don't modify it. 🔄
