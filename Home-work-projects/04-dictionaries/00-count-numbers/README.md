# 00.Number Frequency Counter 🔢📊

This Python program allows the user to input a list of numbers and counts how many times each number appears in the list. It stores the numbers in a list and uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each number. 📋

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program asks the user to input numbers one by one.
2. Once the user enters a blank line, the program stops asking for input.
3. It then counts how many times each number appears in the list.
4. The program outputs the frequency of each number in the list. 📊

## Example 📍

Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 5 Enter a number: 3 Enter a number: 2 Enter a number: 5 Enter a number:
3 appears 2 times. 5 appears 2 times. 2 appears 1 times.
