# 2.Voting Age Checker 🗳️🎉

This Python program prompts the user to input their age and determines if they can vote in three different countries based on their respective voting age requirements. 🧑‍⚖️🌍

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program asks the user for their age. 📝
2. It checks whether the user meets the voting age requirements for three fictional countries:  
   - Peturksbouipo 🇵🇹  
   - Stanlau 🇸🇳  
   - Mayengua 🇲🇾
3. It then prints whether the user can or cannot vote in each of these countries. ✅❌

## Voting Age Requirements 📋

- **Stanlau**: Minimum age to vote is 25 years old. 🗳️
- **Mayengua**: Minimum age to vote is 48 years old. 🗳️
