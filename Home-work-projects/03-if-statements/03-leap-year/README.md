# 3.Leap Year Checker 🌍🌟

This Python program reads a year from the user and determines if it is a **leap year** or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 4 is a leap year. 🗓️

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program prompts the user to input a year. 📝
2. It checks the given year using the leap year rules:
   - If the year is divisible by 4 and (not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400), it is a leap year. 🏅
   - Otherwise, it is not a leap year. ❌
3. The program outputs whether the year is a leap year or not. ✅❌

## Leap Year Rules 📅

- **A year is a leap year** if:
  - It is divisible by 4.
  - It is not divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400.
  
## Example 📍

Please input a year: 2024 That's a leap year!
