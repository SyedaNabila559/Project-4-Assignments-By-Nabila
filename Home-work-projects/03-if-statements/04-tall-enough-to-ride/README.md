# 4.Ride Height Checker 🎢🛑

This Python program asks the user for their height and determines if they meet the minimum height requirement to go on a ride. If they're not tall enough, they are prompted to enter their height again until they meet the requirement. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🚀

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program asks the user to input their height. 📝
2. It checks if the user's height meets the **minimum height** required for the ride. 🎢
   - If the user's height is below the minimum, the program prints a message and asks the user for their height again.
   - If the user's height meets or exceeds the minimum, the program prints a success message. 🎉

## Minimum Height Requirement 📏

- The **minimum height** to ride is **50 inches**. 🎢

## Example 📍

How tall are you? 48 You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year! How tall are you? 52 You're tall enough to ride!
