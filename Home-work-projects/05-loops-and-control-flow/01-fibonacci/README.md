# 1.Fibonacci Sequence Generator 🧮✨
# Description 📜
This program generates terms of the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum value (default: 10,000). The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.

# How the Fibonacci Sequence Works 🔢
Start with: 0, 1

Next terms: Each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, e.g.,
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The program will keep calculating and printing these numbers until it reaches the maximum value (MAX_TERM_VALUE), which is set to 10,000.

# Features 🎯
Generate Fibonacci sequence terms up to a given limit.

Efficient loop to print all terms without exceeding the maximum value.

Easily adjustable maximum term value.

# How It Works 🔄
Initialization: The program starts with the first two terms, 0 and 1.

Loop: The while loop continues to calculate the next term and prints it until the curr_term exceeds MAX_TERM_VALUE.

Output: The program will print each term of the sequence until the condition is met.
