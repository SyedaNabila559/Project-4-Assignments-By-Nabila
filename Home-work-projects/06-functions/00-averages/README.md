# 00.🧮 Average Calculator 📊
# Description 📜
This Python program computes the average of two given numbers, then averages those two results to get a final value. It provides a simple way to compute the midpoints between numbers, which is useful in various contexts, such as averaging results.

# Features 🎯
Takes two numbers as input and calculates their average.

Takes the averages of two sets of numbers and finds the final average.

Prints intermediate and final averages.

# How It Works 🔄
The program calculates the average of the two numbers.

It then calculates the average of the results from the previous calculation.

Finally, it prints out both the intermediate and the final averages.

# Example 🖥️
When you run the program, you will see the following output:


avg_1: 5.0
avg_2: 9.0
final: 7.0
In this case:

avg_1 is the average of 0 and 10, which is 5.0.

avg_2 is the average of 8 and 10, which is 9.0.

The final average is the average of 5.0 and 9.0, which is 7.0.
