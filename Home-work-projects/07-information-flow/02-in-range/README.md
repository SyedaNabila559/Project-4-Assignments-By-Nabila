# 2.🔢 Python Program: Check If Number is in Range 🎯
# Overview 📝
This Python program checks if a number lies within a given range. It takes a number, a lower bound, and an upper bound as inputs and determines if the number is within the specified range (inclusive).

# 🔧 Features
Takes three inputs: a number, a lower bound, and an upper bound.

Checks if the number is between the lower and upper bounds (inclusive).

Prints whether the number is inside or outside the range.

# 🚀 How It Works
The program prompts the user to enter a number (n).

The user enters a lower bound (low) and an upper bound (high).

The program then checks if the number is within the range [low, high] (inclusive).

It will print whether the number is inside the range or not.

# 📝 Example Output:
Enter a number: 10  
Enter the lower bound: 5  
Enter the upper bound: 15  
10 is in the range [5, 15]
