# 00.👨‍💻 Python Program: Checking if a Person is an Adult 🌟
# Overview 📝
This Python program checks if a person qualifies as an adult based on their age. If the age provided is greater than or equal to the defined ADULT_AGE (18 years in the U.S.), the program will return True. Otherwise, it will return False.

# 🔧 Features
Takes user input for a person's age.

Determines if the person is an adult or not based on the age provided.

Handles invalid input with a graceful error message when a non-integer is entered.

# 🚀 How It Works
The program asks the user: "How old is this person?".

It checks if the entered age is greater than or equal to the defined threshold of 18 (the legal adult age in the U.S.).

If the input is valid, it returns True if the person is an adult, and False otherwise.

If the user enters an invalid input (like text instead of numbers), it prompts the user to enter a valid number.00.

# 📝 Example Output:
How old is this person?: 20
True
