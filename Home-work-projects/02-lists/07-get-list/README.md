# 7.Value Collector Program 📝🎉

This Python program allows the user to input values and appends them to a list until an empty input is received. After the user is done entering values, the program prints the final list. 📋

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program prompts the user to input values one by one. 📝
2. The values are added to a list as long as the user keeps providing input. 🔄
3. Once the user presses "Enter" without entering any value, the program prints the list of entered values. 🎉

## Example 📍

Enter a value: Apple Enter a value: Banana Enter a value: Orange Enter a value: Here's the list: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
