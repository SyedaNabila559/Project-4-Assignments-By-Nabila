# 4.Message Copying Program ✍️🔁

This Python program appends a given message to a list three times. It demonstrates how to work with lists and how to append data multiple times. 🎉

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program asks the user to input a message. 📝
2. The `add_three_copies` function appends the message to the list three times. 🔁
3. The program prints the list before and after appending the message. 📋

## Example 📍

Enter a message to copy: Hello! List before: [] List after: ['Hello!', 'Hello!', 'Hello!']
