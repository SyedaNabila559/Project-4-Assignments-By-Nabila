# 2.Double the Numbers in a List 🔢✖️2

This Python program doubles each element in a list of integers and prints the updated list. 🎉  
It demonstrates how to manipulate elements in a list and update their values. 🧑‍💻

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program initializes a list of integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. 📋
2. It iterates through the list, doubling each element in the list. 🔄
3. The list is updated with the new doubled values. 📈
4. Finally, it prints the updated list of numbers. 🎊

## Example 📍

For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program will output:

[2, 4, 6, 8]
