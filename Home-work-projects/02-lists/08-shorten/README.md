# 8.List Shortener Program ✂️📋

This Python program allows the user to input a list of elements. If the list exceeds a maximum length, the program removes elements from the end until the list's length is within the limit. 🎉

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program prompts the user to input elements for the list. 📝
2. The list is shortened by removing elements from the end until the list is at most `MAX_LENGTH` in length. 🔄
3. As elements are removed, they are printed out. 👀

## Example 📍

Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Apple Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Banana Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Orange Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop. Grape Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop.
