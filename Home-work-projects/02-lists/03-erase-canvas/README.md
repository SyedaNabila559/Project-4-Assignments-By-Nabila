# 3.Interactive Canvas Eraser 🎨🖤

This Python program allows you to move an eraser around a 10x10 grid and "erase" sections of the canvas. You can use the W, A, S, D keys to move the eraser around the canvas, and it will remove (turn to black squares) any cells it moves over. 🖤

## How It Works ⚙️

1. The program initializes a 10x10 grid (canvas) with blue cells (`🟪`), which represents the initial state of the canvas. 🎨
2. The user can control an eraser that moves on the grid using the keys `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`. ⬛
3. The eraser removes the cells as it moves (replaces `🟪` with `⬛`). 🧹
4. The user can quit the program by pressing `Q`. 🚪

## Controls 🎮

- **W**: Move the eraser up
- **A**: Move the eraser left
- **S**: Move the eraser down
- **D**: Move the eraser right
- **Q**: Quit the program
